\subsection*{Previously published material}
I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to work with talented and dedicated collaborators on several projects throughout the course of my DPhil. Some of the work presented in this thesis was developed with input from these collaborators and has resulted in peer-reviewed publications and preprints. As scientific ideas and outputs are often generated collaboratively, I use the pronouns "we" throughout this thesis.

In the thesis, any data processing or quality control steps performed by others, or cases where I modified scripts originally created by others, are acknowledged accordingly. The work presented, including all code and analyses used to generate text, figures, and tables, is entirely my own, except where explicitly noted.

Chapters 4 and 5 are adapted from sections of my first-authored preprint, "A scalable variational inference approach for increased mixed-model association power" which is currently under review at Nature Genetics. I have obtained written permission from the editors of the respective journals to reproduce published figures, in part or in full, within my thesis.
