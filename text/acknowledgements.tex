\subsection*{Personal}

This is where you thank your advisor, colleagues, and family and friends.


\subsection*{Institutional}

If you want to separate out your thanks for funding and institutional support, I don't think there's any rule against it.  Of course, you could also just remove the subsections and do one big traditional acknowledgement section.

\subsection*{Previously published material}
I feel deeply grateful for having had the chance to work with talented and dedicated
collaborators on several projects during the course of my DPhil. Some of the work
presented in this thesis has been developed with the input of such collaborators,
and has resulted in peer-reviewed publications and article pre-prints. As scientific
ideas and output are often generated collaboratively, I use the pronouns ``I'' and
``we'' inter-changeably in this thesis.

Throughout the thesis, any data processing or quality control steps that have been
performed by others, or for which I amended scripts originally produced by others,
are acknowledged as such. The work presented in this thesis, including all the code
and analyses to generate text, figures, and tables are a result of my original work,
except as specified in the text.

Chapters 2, 3, and 5 are adapted from sections of: my first-authored pre-print
The genetic architecture of changes in adiposity during adulthood1 and my firstauthored
journal publication Obesity and risk of female reproductive conditions:
A Mendelian Randomisation Study2. I have received written permission from
editors of the respective journals to reproduce published figures in part or in full
in my thesis. I have also received written confirmation from all co-authors of
each publication and my supervisor, Professor Cecilia Lindgren, to reuse parts
of previously published text in my thesis.
